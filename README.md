This repository demonstrates how the [SEGY-SAK](https://segysak.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) library can be used to plot an interactive session with [Jupyter Widgets](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and create a video using a small seismic cube from Equinor's [Vovle dataset](https://data.equinor.com/dataset/Volve).

- Please see the 'seis_viz_tutorial.ipynb' file for the notebook
