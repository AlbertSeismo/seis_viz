# Seismic visualization notebook

This repository demonstrates how the segysak library can be used to plot an interactive session and create a video using a small cube from Equinor's Vovle dataset.

- Please see the 'seis_viz_tutorial.ipynb' file for the notebook
- The video produced by the notebook can be found in the 'volve10r12-full-twt-sub3d.mp4' file
